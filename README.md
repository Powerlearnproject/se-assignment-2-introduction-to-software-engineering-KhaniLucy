4. Implementation (Coding): write the code based on the design of the documents.
5. Testing: test the software to identify and fix defects, ensuring it meets requirements and is high quality.
6. Deployment: releasing the software to the users and make it operational in the intended environment.
7. Maintenance: perform ongoing maintenance to fix bugs, update features, and ensure the software remains functional and relevant.

And different models of SDLC include Waterfall, Agile, Spiral, and V-Model each with its own approach to the sequence and execution of these stages. 

### 3. Phases of the Software Development Life Cycle(SDLC)


1. Planning: initial phase involves defining the project's goals, scope, resources, budget, and timeline. Feasibility studies and risk assessments are conducted to ensure the project's viability.
2. Requirement Analysis: detailed requirements are gathered from stakeholders to understand what the software must achieve. These requirements are documented, reviewed, and approved.
3. Design: based on the requirements, a detailed design of the software is created. This includes system architecture, data models, user interfaces, and system interfaces. Design documents guide the subsequent development phase.
4. Implementation (Coding): developers write the actual code based on the design specifications. This phase invloves converting design documents into functional software components.
5. Testing: the software is rigorously tested to identify and fix defects. Different types of testing, such as unit testing, integration testing, system testing, and user acceptance testing, ensure the software meets requirements and functions correctly.
6. Deployment: the software is released to users. This phase invloves installing the softwafe in the production environment and ensuring that it operates as expected.
7. Maintenance: after deplyment, the software enters the maintenance phase. This invloves fixing bugs, making updates, and improving features to adapt to changing user needs and environments.
